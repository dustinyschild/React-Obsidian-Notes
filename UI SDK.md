What are my goals for the UI SDK?

Q: What categor(y|ies) should this library live under? ([[UI Libraries]])

Q: What should be the focus of the library?
- [x] Components
- [ ] Reusable hooks
	- Idk if this is worth it, although very handy
- [ ] Opinionated Styling
	- This would need to be designed in tandem with UX Designers
		- If a company 'theme' does not gain traction we could go the HeadlessUI route and let each team write their own styles. Managed styles would be preferrable.
- [ ] Build on top of component library
	- This would be a jumping off point, the library could be extended or replaced on an as-needed basis.

Q: Where should documentation exist?
A: I'd like to have thorough documentation & interactive examples in Storybook with links in Confluence 

Q: Tree shaking?
